# Display-Letters-in-WebGL
This is a WebGL application that displays the B and N letters which are the first letter of my name and the last letter of my surname. Letters were constructed using geometric primitives (triangles). In the program, user can change the color of the letters with the range sliders. Also, user can translate the letters using arrows on the keyboard and can rotate or scale the letters clicking the buttons and menubar.
